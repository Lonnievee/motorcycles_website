            <h2>About the Developer</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am <strong>Alon Dorfman</strong>, a student who is learning web development at the moment. This project is a part of my coursework, where I have built a website themed around motorcycles.</p>
            <h3>My Experience Developing This Website</h3>
            <p>
                Building the website has been an exciting and fulfilling experience. I was engaged in the design and development of four of their pages (Home Page, About Us Page, CRUD Operations Page, and Data Analytics Page) that are connected together. During this stage of the practice, I obtained the following skills:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML5: For the structuring of the contents on the website.</li>
                <li>CSS3: For the design of the site and incorporating visual features to appeal to users and make it responsive.</li>
                <li>JavaScript: For introducing extra features and executing the CRUD operations.</li>
                <li>Chart.js: For the data visualization of the motorcycle sales.</li>
                <li>Google Sheets: Learned how to store the data on the Google sheet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I encountered problems like how to design a responsive layout and how to use the CRUD functions. However, these challenges also taught me stronger web development skills which I can use later on.
            </p>
            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
